    <string name="aboutapp">CS Square is intended to help students including myself in better
        preparing and mastering coding interview. Not only does it contains more than 300++ coding
        questions provided with concise solutions, it also has quick note section for preparation, mock interview,
        short answers and etc. I am thinking to make this app even more versatile - maybe providing useful articles
        from the Internet, letting user to create their own flash card, or implementing a fun and
        addictive platform to learn new materials. That is all about CS Square!
